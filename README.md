# Monetary Policy Rates 
1. Bank Rate
   The bank rate is the long-term rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks.It influences long-term lending rates in the economy.When RBI increases the bank rate → borrowing becomes expensive → economic activity slows → stock market may react negatively.

2. Repo Rate
   Repo (Repurchase) Rate is the rate at which RBI lends short-term money to commercial banks against government securities.It is the most important monetary policy tool.When repo rate increases: borrowing becomes costlier,loans (home, business) become expensive,liquidity reduces,stock market tends to fall.When repo rate decreases:liquidity increases,investment rises,
stock market usually gains.

3. Reverse Repo Rate
   Reverse Repo Rate is the rate at which RBI borrows money from commercial banks.It is used to control liquidity.Higher reverse repo rate → banks prefer depositing money with RBI → money supply reduces.Lower reverse repo rate → more money remains in the economy.

# Stock Market Variables 
1. Nifty 50 Stock Price
   The Nifty 50 is India’s major stock market index, consisting of 50 large companies across sectors.It is used as a benchmark for Indian stock market performance. Daily closing prices are used for analysis.

2. Stock Returns
   Stock return is the percentage change in stock price.You can calculate daily, monthly, or yearly returns.
Formula: stock return = cuurent month price - previous month price/previous month price * 100.
