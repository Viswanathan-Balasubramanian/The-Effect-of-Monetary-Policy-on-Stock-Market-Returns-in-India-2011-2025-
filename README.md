# The-Effect-of-Monetary-Policy-on-Stock-Market-Returns-in-India-2011-2025-
This project is about how the monetary rates like bank rate ,repo rate, reverse repo affects the stock market and how it is impacting in the real world.it also studies about how CPI inflation rate affects the market and monetary rates too. 

# Monetary Policy Rates 
1. Bank Rate
   The bank rate is the long-term rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks.It influences long-term lending rates in the economy.When RBI increases the bank rate → borrowing becomes expensive → economic activity slows → stock market may react negatively.

2. Repo Rate
   Repo (Repurchase) Rate is the rate at which RBI lends short-term money to commercial banks against government securities.It is the most important monetary policy tool.When repo rate increases: borrowing becomes costlier,loans (home, business) become expensive,liquidity reduces,stock market tends to fall.When repo rate decreases:liquidity increases,investment rises,
stock market usually gains.

3. Reverse Repo Rate
   Reverse Repo Rate is the rate at which RBI borrows money from commercial banks.It is used to control liquidity.Higher reverse repo rate → banks prefer depositing money with RBI → money supply reduces.Lower reverse repo rate → more money remains in the economy.

# Stock Market Variables 
1. Nifty 50 Stock Price
   The Nifty 50 is India’s major stock market index, consisting of 50 large companies across sectors.It is used as a benchmark for Indian stock market performance. Daily closing prices are used for analysis.

2. Stock Returns
   Stock return is the percentage change in stock price.You can calculate daily, monthly, or yearly returns.
Formula: stock return = cuurent month price - previous month price/previous month price * 100.
Example:
If price changes from 10,000 to 10,500 → return = 5%.
Stock returns show how the market reacts to interest rate changes, inflation, and economic news.

 # CPI (Consumer Price Index) – Explained

1. CPI Combined Inflation
   CPI Combined is the overall inflation rate in India.It measures price changes across:food,housing,transportation,clothing and health.It represents inflation for both rural + urban areas combined.RBI uses this as the main inflation measure when deciding repo rate.

2. CPI Urban Inflation
   Measures the inflation specifically for urban areas. Covers:rent,transport,services,education and healthcare.Urban inflation affects salaried workers and businesses in cities.

3. CPI Rural Inflation
   Measures inflation in rural areas. Covers: food,fuel,agricultural goods and rural wages.Rural inflation impacts farmers and rural households.
